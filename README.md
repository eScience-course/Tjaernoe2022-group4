# eScience Course 2022 Project Template

[This template](https://github.com/eScience-course/escience2022-template) provides a starting point for [eScience Course](https://www.aces.su.se/research/projects/escience-tools-in-climate-science-linking-observations-with-modelling/) work groups.

### What's included?

1. `notebooks`: a place for storing Jupyter Notebooks.  
1. `README.md`: this document - consider modifying to make it a description of your project on GitHub.
1. `LICENSE`: a default (MIT) license file for your project. You can change this if you feel the need.

### How to use this Template

Project leads should follow the next four steps. This only needs to be done once.

1. Navigate to https://github.com/eScience-course/escience2022-template
2. Click the "Use this template" button
3. Name your work group's project 
4. Provide a brief description
5. Tell your teammates where to find your repository and tell them to "Fork" the project.

Once the initial setup is done, everyone will want to clone the repository onto the compute system they plan to use for the hackathon.

1. Open a JupyterLab session on the system you plan to use.  
https://pangeo-eosc.vm.fedcloud.eu/jupyterhub/
1. Click the github extension and pull the cloned repository! 
1. Now you are ready to work ;-) 

It would be good to start by copying the https://github.com/pangeo-data/escience-2022/blob/main/tutorial/pangeo101/data_discovery.ipynb into your notebooks directory!



### How to make your project citable

[Zenodo](https://about.zenodo.org/) is a data archiving tool that can help make your project citable by assigning a DOI to the project's GitHub repository.

Follow the guidelines here https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code


### How to create Research Object

Creating [Research Object](https://youtu.be/w39xvNrqTR8) increases significantly the FAIRness of your work. 

1. Sign up to [https://reliance.rohub.org](https://reliance.rohub.org) using your [orcid](https://orcid.org) identifier (register if you do not have one yet). See [video](https://youtu.be/ZoRPxLJGJT8).
2. Follow the [RoHub documentation](https://reliance-eosc.github.io/ROHUB-API_documentation/html/tutorials.html) to create an Executable Research Object where you can add a link to your jupyter notebook on Github, The main advantage of creating Rsearch Object is to add metadata and increase the FAIRness of your research work. All Research Objects in Rohub are searchable and accessible from [OpenAire Explore](https://explore.openaire.eu).


**Examples of Research Objects (eScience Course 2021)**:

- [A song of Ice and Phytoplankton by Astrid Bragstad Gjelsvik](https://w3id.org/ro-id/183f2862-7509-4343-8ec9-74775b642c8d)
- [OCTOPUS project - explOring aerosol-Cloud inTeractiOns in CMIP6 models Using joint-histogramS by Adele Zaini](https://w3id.org/ro-id/dd948b04-bfa4-44b0-814b-19f7daff6b8c)

**The Environmental Data Science Book**

[The Environmental Data Science book](https://the-environmental-ds-book.netlify.app/welcome.html) is a living, open and community-driven online resource to showcase and support the publication of data, research and open-source tools for collaborative, reproducible and transparent Environmental Data Science. An executable Research Object is created for each Jupyter Notebook deposited to the Environmental Data Science book.
