# eScience Course 2022 - Group 4

Polar Oceans in a Changing Climate


### Contents

1. `notebooks`: a place for storing Jupyter Notebooks.  


### Getting started

1. Open a Jupyter hub session on pangeo : https://pangeo-eosc.vm.fedcloud.eu/jupyterhub/

1. Generate ssh key on pangeo with terminal of jupyterhub and add it to your github account :
[Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

1. Clone with github extension using ssh : `git@github.com:eScience-course/Tjaernoe2022-group4.git`

1. Now you are ready to work ;-) 

1. To push you need to configure Git, in particular set your user name and email address, from the terminal :

         $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
         $ git config --global user.email yourname@example.com

#### Extra

##### How to make your project citable

[Zenodo](https://about.zenodo.org/) is a data archiving tool that can help make your project citable by assigning a DOI to the project's GitHub repository.

Follow the guidelines here https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code


#### How to create Research Object

Creating [Research Object](https://youtu.be/w39xvNrqTR8) increases significantly the FAIRness of your work. 

1. Sign up to [https://reliance.rohub.org](https://reliance.rohub.org) using your [orcid](https://orcid.org) identifier (register if you do not have one yet). See [video](https://youtu.be/ZoRPxLJGJT8).
2. Follow the [RoHub documentation](https://reliance-eosc.github.io/ROHUB-API_documentation/html/tutorials.html) to create an Executable Research Object where you can add a link to your jupyter notebook on Github, The main advantage of creating Rsearch Object is to add metadata and increase the FAIRness of your research work. All Research Objects in Rohub are searchable and accessible from [OpenAire Explore](https://explore.openaire.eu).


**Examples of Research Objects (eScience Course 2021)**:

- [A song of Ice and Phytoplankton by Astrid Bragstad Gjelsvik](https://w3id.org/ro-id/183f2862-7509-4343-8ec9-74775b642c8d)
- [OCTOPUS project - explOring aerosol-Cloud inTeractiOns in CMIP6 models Using joint-histogramS by Adele Zaini](https://w3id.org/ro-id/dd948b04-bfa4-44b0-814b-19f7daff6b8c)

**The Environmental Data Science Book**

[The Environmental Data Science book](https://the-environmental-ds-book.netlify.app/welcome.html) is a living, open and community-driven online resource to showcase and support the publication of data, research and open-source tools for collaborative, reproducible and transparent Environmental Data Science. An executable Research Object is created for each Jupyter Notebook deposited to the Environmental Data Science book.
